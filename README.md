- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CBHutch92!
- I'm a Programmer Analyst for a local utilities company where I started in January 2025.
- In December 2024 I graduated with a B.S. in Information Technology and a Data Analytics concentration. I also have a B.S. in Business Administration and a Management concentration that I completed in May 2018.
- At work, we as a company tend to use a lot of C#, VBA, and SQL/SSMS. *My* current projects tend to revolve around FTP/SFTP automation, but I've also done some work with PowerShell scripts that run on our remote radio reading laptops used by our field crew. 
- In my free time, I enjoy learning about and completing projects with Python, SQL, R, and PowerBI.
- When I have time to work on them, I hope to start on projects related to soccer (football) and fantasy football. I will also be taking the time to update my repositories with updates on previous projects I worked on in school now that I have enhanced my skills.
- Thanks for taking the time to check out my profile!
